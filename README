# GeoHex for Scala DESCRIPTION
GeoHex V3 for Scala implemented by @pomu0325.

# GeoHex object
* GeoHex object can convert between latitude/longitude and GeoHex
  V3: ported from
    JavaScript implementation by @sa2da (http://geohex.net/hex_v3_core.js), and
    Java implementation by @chshii (https://github.com/chsh/geohex4j)

  Currently only #decode, #encode, #getZoneByLocation and #getZoneByCode methods are ready.
  Other methods will be provided after well tested.

# INSTALL
* copy GeoHex.scala and package.scala from ./src/main/scala/net/geohex directory into your app.

  or
  
* run 'sbt package' and copy created jar file into your project

# USAGE

  import net.geohex._

  val code: String = GeoHex.encode(35.780516755235475, 139.57031250000003, 9)
  // code -> "XM566370240"
  val zone1: Zone = GeoHex.getZoneByLocation(35.780516755235475, 139.57031250000003, 9)
  // zone1.code -> "XM566370240"

  val zone2: Zone = GeoHex.decode("XM566370240") // decode method is an alias of getZoneByCode.
  // zone2.lat -> 35.78044332128247
  // zone2.lon -> 139.57018747142203
  // zone2.level -> 9
  // zone2.hexSize -> 37.70410702222824
  val polygon: List[Loc] = z.hexCoords
  // [0]:{35.780516755235475,139.33593750000003}
  // [1]:{35.945011915675025,139.45312500000006}
