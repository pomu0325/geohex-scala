GeoHex for Scala

# GeoHex for Scala DESCRIPTION
GeoHex V2 for Scala implemented by @pomu0325.
http://twitter.com/pomu0325

# GeoHex object
* GeoHex object can convert between latitude/longitude and GeoHex
  V2: ported from 
    JavaScript implementation by @sa2da (http://geohex.net/hex_v2.03_core.js), and
    Java implementation by @chshii (https://github.com/chsh/geohex4j)

  Currently only #decode, #encode, #getZoneByLocation and #getZoneByCode methods are ready.
  Other methods will be provided after well tested.

# INSTALL
* copy GeoHex.scala and package.scala from ./src/main/scala/net/geohex directory into your app.

  or
  
* run 'sbt package' and copy created jar file into your project

# USAGE

  import net.geohex._

  val code: String = GeoHex.encode(35.780516755235475, 139.57031250000003, 9)
  // code -> "jjdK3"
  val z: Zone = GeoHex.decode("jjdK3") // decode method is an alias of getZoneByCode.
  // z.lat -> 35.780516755235475
  // z.lon -> 139.57031250000003
  // z.level -> 9
  // z.getHexSize() -> 13045.252825520833
  val polygon: Array[Loc] = z.polygon
  // [0]:{35.780516755235475,139.33593750000003}
  // [1]:{35.945011915675025,139.45312500000006}
  // [2]:{35.945011915675025,139.68750000000006}
  // [3]:{35.780516755235475,139.80468750000006}
  // [4]:{35.61568052680066,139.68750000000006}
  // [5]:{35.61568052680066,139.45312500000006}

  or

  val zone1: Zone = GeoHex.getZoneByLocation(35.780516755235475, 139.57031250000003, 9)
  // zone1.code -> "jjdK3"
  val zone2: Zone = GeoHex.getZoneByCode("jjdK3")
  // zone2.lat -> 35.780516755235475
  // zone2.lon -> 139.57031250000003
  // zone2.level -> 9
  // ...
  val zone3: Zone = GeoHex.getZoneByXY(293.0, -104.0, 9)
  // zone3.lat -> 35.780516755235475
  // zone3.lon -> 139.57031250000003
  // zone3.level -> 9
